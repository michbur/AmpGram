#' Prediction of antimicrobial peptides
#'
#' Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are ancient and evolutionarily conserved 
#' molecules widespread in all living organisms that participate in host 
#' defence and/or microbial competition. Due to their positive charge, 
#' hydrophobicity and amphipathicity, they preferentially disrupt 
#' negatively-charged bacterial membranes. AMPs are considered an important 
#' alternative to traditional antibiotics, especially in times when the latter 
#' are drastically losing their effectiveness. Therefore, efficient computational 
#' tools for AMP prediction are essential to identify the best AMP candidates without 
#' undertaking expensive experimental studies. AmpGram is our novel tool for predicting 
#' AMPs based on the stacked random forests and n-gram analysis, able to
#' successfully predict antimicrobial peptides in proteomes.
#' 
#' AmpGram is available as R function (\code{\link{predict.ampgram_model}}) or
#' shiny GUI (\code{\link{AmpGram_gui}}).
